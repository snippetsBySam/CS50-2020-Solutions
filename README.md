Disclaimer: These solutions are a result of me working my way through the course and are a product of my work only. Please abide by CS50's [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/syllabus/#academic-honesty) policy and do **NOT** copy the solutions. It is meant for those who have completed the course and are curious to compare solutions with others.


Since completing the course, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to Computer Science. Dr. David Malan and his assistants are excellent lecturers and the accompanying problem sets challenge students and help them develop the much needed problem-solving skills and mindset.

The course can be found on [edX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/).
